# aither

Aither shows an approach how to bootstrap a microservice system with [Hemera](https://github.com/hemerajs/hemera) and docker.
You can scale your worker in seconds and because we use NATS as â€œnervous system" for our distributed system we do not have to carry about service-discovery or load-balancing.

This configuration will setup:

* [Hapi](https://github.com/hapijs/hapi) server which act as api-gataway to the Hemera services.
* [Microservice](https://github.com/hemerajs/aither/blob/master/worker/index.js) which is responsible to add two numbers.
* [NATS](https://github.com/nats-io/gnatsd) server the messaging system.
* [Zipkin](http://zipkin.io/) dashboard to monitoring your distributed system.
* [Natsboard](https://github.com/devfacet/natsboard) dashboard to monitoring your NATS system in realtime.
* [Traefik](https://traefik.io/) modern HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer made to deploy microservices with ease.

## Running the system
```sh
docker-compose up
```

## Scaling the system
```
docker-compose scale worker=5 api=2
```

## Run load test

```
npm install -g artillery
artillery run loadtest.yml
```

# Start a request load balanced by traefik

```
http://localhost:8182/api/add?a=1&b=10
```

### Traefik dashboard

[http://localhost:8181/](http://localhost:8181/)

### NATS dashboard

[http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

### NATS monitoring endpoint

[http://localhost:8222/](http://localhost:8222/)

### Zipkin dashboard

[http://localhost:9411/](http://localhost:9411/)

### Example REST endpoint

[http://localhost:8789/add?a=4&b=8](http://localhost:8789/api/add?a=4&b=8)
